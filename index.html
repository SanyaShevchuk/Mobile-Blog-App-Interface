        <p>he following is the original piece I wrote for
          CNN last year entrepreneurs, also known as
          "digital nomads." Since the whole "Work Online,
          Travel the World and Live the Dream" angle had
          been done to death in a million places, I decided
          to go the other direction and show the dark side
          of being a digital nomad â€” the challenges one faces,
          the emotional pitfalls, the social sacrifices.
          <br><br>
          Predictably, CNN hated it. The editors hacked it
          to pieces and asked me to rewrite sections to
          make it less gloomy. But I was always fond of
          the original, so I'm posting it here unabridged.

            Good point! There are travel bloggers. Then
            there are freelance: coders mainly.

            Not one family in amongst that. Being nomadic
            is easier when you only have 1 person to
            worry about

            Not saying it's not doable, some good friends
            of mine manage it but would have been a better article
            with a 50/50

            here people do business from the road
            (running an IT company, travelling and filming
            their travels).
